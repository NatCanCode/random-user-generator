# random-user-generator technical home test

## Objective:  
Create a functioning project that accesses and displays API data from the Random User Generator beautifully, and effectively. 

## Description: 
This project will test your ability craft a small app, to integrate an API with an app/site, as well as test your CSS skills. Your goal is to take a framework of your choosing and build a User card that is similar to what you find here (https://randomuser.me/). Your app should integrate with the API presented on the Random User site (see previous link, under “How to use” section), and use that data to populate your User card.  

## Some things to note: 
Again, use any framework you want to build the project. As long as we can run it, it’s good! 
Take this opportunity to show us your design skills, and have fun with the design! 

### If all goes well, you should complete this task in a couple of hours.
